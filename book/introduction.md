Welcome to the `pyhf` tutorial given at [PyHEP 2020](https://indico.cern.ch/event/882824/)!
We'll first point you towards our documentation website and recommend that you visit it for much more detailed explanations and examples.
We don't have a lot of time today, so let's dive right in.

We won't review the full pedagogy of `HistFactory`, so instead we'll point you to
the [`pyhf` talk at SciPy 2020](https://github.com/matthewfeickert/talk-SciPy-2020).

Instead, let's move to looking at the `pyhf` API right away.
